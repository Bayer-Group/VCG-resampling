Data was stored in the standard for exchange of non-clinical data format, introduced by the clinical data interchange standards consortium (CDISC) https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/send.
The SEND-implementation guideline can be found here: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/send/sendig-v3-1
The following SEND data was abstracted from the following domains:
LB (laboratory domain)
BW (body weight)
TS (trial summary)
TG (trial groups)
DM (demographics).

The following information can be seen in the data
USUBJID - unique subject ID of each animal.
STUDYID - study id of the used studies.
DOSDUR - duration of the dosing period.
ROUTE - route of administration.
LBTEST - tested parameter of the LB domain.
LBTESTCD - parameter code of the tested parameter.
LBCAT - category of the tested LB parameters (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, etc).
LBORRES - numeric value of the measured parameter.
LBORRESU - unit of the measured value.
LBMETHOD - methodology/gauge which was used for measurement.
LBSPEC - anatomical region of the measurement (e.g., serum, plasma, urine, etc).
SEX - sex of the animals.
INITBW - initial body weight, i.e. bodyweight measured at study day 1 before first treatment exposure.
BWORRESU - unit of body weight.
SPECIES - species of the animals (e.g., rat, dog, monkey, etc).
STRAIN - strain of the animals (e.g., Wistar HAN, Sprague Dawley, etc).
TRTV - treatment vehicel (e.g. Ethanol/KolliphorHS15/Water, Solutol, etc).
START_YEAR - year of study initiation.
AGE - age of the animals at study initiation (in weeks).
ANESTHETICS - anesthetics used for animal sedation during blood withdrawal.
